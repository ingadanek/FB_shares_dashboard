# Dashboard shares

Using Python and its packages to create a graphical dashboard to make decisions about buying or selling e.g. Facebook shares.

To do this, the share prices together with the moving average over the last 14 days were displayed. When the current price falls below the average, this is a sign that we are on the upside and need to sell. In addition, selling volume information was included in the dashboard so that it's easier to detect unusual events.
